        <h2>About the project</h2>
        <p>
          Falling Fruit is a celebration of the overlooked culinary bounty of
          our city streets. By quantifying this resource on an interactive map,
          we hope to facilitate intimate connections between people, food, and
          the natural organisms growing in our neighborhoods. Not just a free
          lunch! Foraging in the 21st century is an opportunity for urban
          exploration, to fight the scourge of stained sidewalks, and to
          reconnect with the botanical origins of food. Our edible map is not
          the first of its kind, but it aspires to be the world's most
          comprehensive. While our users contribute locations of their own, we
          comb the internet for pre-existing knowledge, seeking to unite the
          efforts of foragers, foresters, and freegans everywhere. The imported
          datasets range from small neighborhood foraging maps to vast
          professionally-compiled tree inventories. This so far amounts to 2,959
          different types of edibles (most, but not all, plant species)
          distributed over 1,478,212 locations. Beyond the cultivated and
          commonplace to the exotic flavors of foreign plants and long-forgotten
          native plants, foraging in your neighborhood is a journey through time
          and across cultures. Join us in celebrating hyper-local food! The map
          is open for anyone to edit, the database can be downloaded with just
          one click, and the{' '}
          <a href="https://github.com/falling-fruit/"> code</a> is open-source.
          You are likewise encouraged to share the bounty with your fellow
          humans. Our sharing page lists hundreds of local organizations -
          planting public orchards and food forests, picking otherwise-wasted
          fruits and vegetables from city trees and farmers' fields, and sharing
          with neighbors and the needy.

          Harvesting food in an urban setting comes with certain practical and
          moral considerations. For an introduction to the ethics of urban
          foraging, we recommend the following summary. Information on Falling
          Fruit may be wrong or out of date. For example, many of the foraging
          maps migrated to Falling Fruit were hosted as public Google Maps on
          which markers were often moved accidentally, and municipal tree
          inventories are updated only (if ever) as trees are visited for
          maintenance. Be prepared to encounter inaccuracies in the field, and
          please edit the map as needed based on your discoveries. Ultimately,
          it is your responsibility to determine the identity, edibility, and
          location of a plant, and the responsibility of all to improve the
          quality of the map.
