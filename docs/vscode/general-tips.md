# General Tips

When pairing with devs this semester, I was surprised that a lot of people weren't using these features. They get used a lot, so please give them a try.

## Shortcuts

### Quickly opening a file

`Cmd-P` and start typing the name of the file you're looking for. This uses _fuzzy search_, so you don't have to get the spelling exactly right (e.g. if you type `mc.js`, it'll find `MapContext.js`).

### Search throughout project

`Cmd-Shift-F` (since `Cmd-F` is only for the current file).

### Go to Definition and References

`Right-click`, or `F12` for Definition and `Shift-F12` for References.

### Quickly finding a VS Code command (command palette)

`Cmd-Shift-P` (same as typing `>` after `Cmd-P`) to show all available commands in VS Code and search, so you don't have to go find them. Note the keyboard shortcuts on the right.

### Switching between the current and last opened tabs

`Ctrl-Tab` (and `Ctrl-Shift-Tab`) opens the tab list, which is in order of when each tab was last opened in the current editor (pane).
