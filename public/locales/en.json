By quantifying this resource on an interactive map, we hope to facilitate intimate connections between people, food, and the natural organisms growing in our neighborhoods. Not just a free lunch! Foraging in the 21st century is an opportunity for urban exploration, to fight the scourge of stained sidewalks, and to reconnect with the botanical origins of food.",
      "edible_map": "Our edible map is not the first of its kind, but it aspires to be the world's most comprehensive. While our users contribute locations of their own, we comb the internet for pre-existing knowledge, seeking to unite the efforts of foragers, foresters, and freegans everywhere. The imported datasets range from small neighborhood foraging maps to vast professionally-compiled tree inventories. This so far amounts to thousands of different types of edibles (most, but not all, plant species) distributed over millions of locations. Beyond the cultivated and commonplace to the exotic flavors of foreign plants and long-forgotten native plants, foraging in your neighborhood is a journey through time and across cultures.",

The <a href=\"/map\">map</a> is open for anyone to edit, the database can be <a href=\"/data\">downloaded</a> with just one click, and the <a href=\"https://github.com/falling-fruit\">code</a> is open-source. You are likewise encouraged to share the bounty with your fellow humans.

He created Falling Fruit with Caleb Phillips in 2013 to promote urban foraging worldwide, and co-founded <a href=\"https://fruitrescue.org/\">Community Fruit Rescue</a> in 2014 to harvest and distribute surplus fruit growing around him in Boulder, Colorado. Beyond fruit, he juggles a <a href=\"https://www.weltyphotography.com/index\">photography career</a>, <a href=\"https://instaar.colorado.edu/people/ethan-welty/\">research on glaciers</a>, and an appetite for mountainous and riverine pursuits.",

His first mission for Falling Fruit was to comb Boulder and Salt Lake City, paper maps in-hand, to record fruiting trees. When not working to improve building energy efficiency, he is usually helping out in the community or moving quickly over mountains by foot, ski, or bicycle.",

Her roots stretch deep into the Rocky Mountains, but these days her aboveground biomass is proud to call New Haven, Connecticut her home. She can often be found tending public food forests, reading enraptured in some cozy library corner, or waxing poetic about the magic of mycelium (and, supposedly, completing joint graduate degrees at the Yale <a href=\"https://environment.yale.edu/\"> School of Forestry</a> and <a href=\"https://jackson.yale.edu/person/emily-sigman/\">School of Global Affairs</a>).

Besides all that work stuff, he likes to climb rocks, run trails, ride bikes, and generally be outdoors as much as possible. Caleb created Falling Fruit with Ethan Welty in 2013 and served on the board of directors for 6 years before taking a position on the Advisory Board.",

Noticing that a lot of this food was still suitable for human consumption led him to the realization that good, fresh food was being wasted on a colossal scale. Tristram has since worked tirelessly to bring this issue to the attention of the public, the media, and policy-makers. He founded the food waste campaign organization <a href=\"https://feedbackglobal.org/\"> Feedback Global</a> and wrote <a href=\"https://www.tristramstuart.co.uk/\">Waste: Uncovering the Global Food Scandal</a> to demonstrate the extent of the problem on a global scale.
